# Gravesters

A project which attempts to make tracking the progression of Graves Disease, for people who are suffering from it.

## About Graves Disease
Graves disease is an **Auto-Immune** disorder where the Thyroid Gland starts producing an excessive amount of Thyroid Hormones,
leading to toxicity.
It is estimated that about **2 to 3%** of the population i.e roughly **10 million** people in the world suffer from it.
Women are shown to have significantly higher risk of having Graves Disease.

## How do I intend to help ?
Auto-Immune disorders are usually chronic and require meticulous tracking of symptoms / Lab Reports, pills appointments etc over a course of
several years in order to accurately fight the disease.

This website intends to start by providing the following features:
1. Registration.
2. Providing a dashboard to allow the following-
    - Tracking Lab Reports.
    - Provide visualizations in the form of Charts etc to better understand the progression.
    - Allow users to enter historical data for reports / treatments / notes etc.
    - Allow users to download reports concerning different areas of the disease.
